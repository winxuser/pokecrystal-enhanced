# Pokémon Crystal [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal.
=======
This is a ROMhack of Pokémon Crystal.

### Description

Pokémon Copper is not a difficulty hack or a catch-em-all, although it modifies the difficulty of boss trainers and allows for a wider selection of Pokémon. This is a reimagining of the second generation by me, essentially answering the question "What if I was in charge of making the Pokémon games?"

It includes the following features:
- A modified story, that tries to answer some questions that the original games left unanswered
- Bugfixes that attempt to remedy the oddities of Generation 2 battling
- Boss trainer battles and Rival battles have been modified. Regular trainers have been left unmodified.
- Some but not all Pokémon have received a type change, based off their Pokédex entry and if I thought their typing made sense. The intent was to reduce duplicate type fatigue (Normal/Flying is a good example)
- Pokémon stats have been rounded up to the nearest value ending in 0, i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc. This was to give every Pokémon a universal small buff.
- All wild encounters have been changed to allow for a greater variety of Pokémon to be captured.
- All Pokémon level-up moves have been changed. Generally, a Pokémon will learn a new move every 5 levels or upon evolution up until a certain level. For example, Moltres originally learned 3 moves by level-up, but now learns 12
- GS Ball and Celebi event restored
- Instant Text scrolling speed option
- Physical/Special Split
- Running Shoes (credit to [Tom Wang](https://github.com/froyomuffin) and [Seasick](https://github.com/SeasickShore))

- Move Reminder
- Infinitely reusable TMs
- HMs renamed to FMs (Field Moves)
- Show move name for TMs and FMs when obtained
- Fish while surfing
- Removal of Cut as an FM, in replacement with the 'Chainsaw' item
- Allow using a field move if a Pokémon in your party can learn it
- Repels will ask if you want to use another
- Addition of a Master Repel, that acts as a toggleable infinite repel
- Short beeping noise for low HP instead of continuous beeping
- Lottery Corner generates a lucky number daily instead of weekly
- Headbutt works with both Kanto and Johto trees
- Pokémon can evolve by holding a certain item when levelling up
- Grass Types are immune to Powder-based or Spore-based moves
- Steel Types are no longer poisoned by Twineedle
- 252 Party Menu Icons (251 Pokémon + 1 Egg), credit to [LuigiTKO](https://twitter.com/LuigiTKO) and [GuiAbel](https://twitter.com/guiabel/)
- Colored Party Menu Icons
- Unique colors for each thrown Pokéball
